xDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface. It is an updated and lightly maintained fork of the abandoned <a href="https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui">eDEX-UI-Project</a>.

.
Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room)), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *"[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less « art » and more « distributable software »"*. xDEX-UI is an effort to continue that project.

While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Features
- Fully featured terminal emulator with tabs, colors, mouse events, and support for `curses` and `curses`-like applications.
- Real-time system (CPU, RAM, swap, processes) and network (GeoIP, active connections, transfer rates) monitoring.
- Full support for touch-enabled displays, including an on-screen keyboard.
- Directory viewer that follows the CWD (current working directory) of the terminal.
- Advanced customization using themes, on-screen keyboard layouts, CSS injections. See the [wiki](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann/xdex-ui/wiki) for more info.
- Optional sound effects made by a talented sound designer for maximum hollywood hacking vibe.

## Q&A
#### How do I get it?
Click on the little badges under the xDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann/xdex-ui/releases) tab, or download it through [one of the available repositories](https://repology.org/project/edex-ui/versions) (Homebrew, AUR...).

Public release binaries are unsigned ([why](https://gaby.dev/posts/code-signing)). On Linux, you will need to `chmod +x` the AppImage file in order to run it.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann/xdex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you're confident it hasn't been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it's been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you'll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can't disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.
#### Why is the file browser saying that "Tracking Failed"? (Windows only)
On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you're going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen.
Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a "detached" mode. You can still use it to browse files & directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal.

## Configuration

After launching xDEX-UI for the first time, default configuration files will be created in `$HOME/.config/xDEX-UI/`.

`settings.json`: General settings.
`shortcuts.json`: Keyboard shortcuts.

When reporting an issue, please test to see if it also occurs after deleting this directory to have it recreated with default settings (create a backup first).

## Useful commands for the nerds

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running xDEX-UI from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you'd like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions. As of today, only Linux is officially tested and supported.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You'll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

The script will minify the source code, recompile native dependencies and create distributable assets in the `dist` folder.

#### Getting the bleeding edge
If you're interested in running the latest in-development version but don't want to compile source code yourself, you can can get pre-built nightly binaries on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann/xdex-ui/actions): click the latest commits, and download the artifacts bundle for your OS.

## Credits
eDEX-UI's original source code was primarily written by [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). This fork, xDEX-UI is currently being maintained by [me](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped getting started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice for the original project.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x+ of the original project. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

## Thanks
Of course, xDEX-UI would never have existed without the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/andreas-hartmann/xdex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob "Arscan" Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.
